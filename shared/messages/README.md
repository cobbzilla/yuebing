================
These are the string tables that define every message that appears in the web interface.

Everything other than English was generated using [hokeylization](https://github.com/cobbzilla/hokeylization),
so they're all from Google Translate and are guaranteed to have mistakes!

Corrections are very welcome! Send a [pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/cobbzilla/yuebing/pulls),
or if you're not comfortable doing that, [open an issue](https://github.com/cobbzilla/yuebing/issues).

When you create a new GitHub issue about a translation, please do:
* include the page URL (copy/paste from browser address bar)
* include the exact text that is wrong (copy/paste from browser) 
* kindly offer a suggestion of a better translation
* **Thank you!**
