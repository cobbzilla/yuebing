# Copy this file, edit to your liking, and save it as .env
#
# The only required environment variables are the ones that have "REQUIRED"
# just before them. They are also the only var definitions that are not
# commented-out.
#
# All other env variables have sensible defaults
#
# All environment variables begin with YB_
# So, to dump your current Yuebing env vars: `env | grep ^YB_ | sort`
#
# The most important things to configure here are:
#  * admin user: email/password
#  * storage: cloud vendor credentials & params
#
# Read more about configuration in docs/config.md

# For s3: AWS Access Key for Yuebing system storage (s3)
# For b2: Key ID

# REQUIRED: cloud "secret" credential
# For s3: AWS Secret Key for Yuebing system storage (s3)
# For b2: Application Key
export YB_DEST_SECRET=your-AWS-secret-key

# REQUIRED: bucket name (S3) or bucket ID (B2)
# For S3, use the bucket name. For B2, use the bucket ID (not the name!)

# See: https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/b2_authorize_account.html
#export YB_DEST_B2_PART_SIZE=10000000

# Encryption and password hashing  #
####################################
# If set, all stored data will be encrypted with this key
# Note: There will be a performance hit when using encrypted storage
# Generous cache thresholds can help
# To rotate the key, use the web admin "Migrate Data" functionality, or use mobiletto-cli to

#####################################
# The YB_WORK_ settings are NOT saved in the persisted configuration, since they
# are system-dependent.
#
# These vars are initialized when Yuebing starts, from the environment (for Docker, the .env file)
# To change these you have to restart Yuebing with new YB_WORK_ settings

# YB_WORK_DIR is where temporary files are written
#
# When running in docker, this directory is bind-mounted on the host, NOT in the container
# Within the docker container, YB_WORK_DIR is always /usr/src/scratch
#
# The default is '/tmp/yuebing_workdir'
# If you'll be transforming a lot of files, change this!
# Ensure this directory is on a spacious volume.
#
# This directory should be OUTSIDE the yuebing source tree!
# Otherwise, it may get mapped into the image/container if you run in docker-dev mode
#export YB_WORK_DIR=/tmp/yuebing_workdir

# YB_WORK_MAX_LOAD is the maximum system load before jobs start delaying themselves
# Our job queue management has some issues where too many jobs get spawned
#
# This setting provides a ceiling to prevent the system from grinding to a stop
# The default value is 2 * (number of CPUs)
#export YB_WORK_MAX_LOAD=10

# When processing a very large media library, the upload step can take a long time
# Things you can do:
#   Set YB_WORK_UPLOADS_CONCURRENCY to a larger number to process more uploads concurrently
#     - If this is too high, you might get rate-limit errors from your cloud storage provider
#   Set YB_WORK_UPLOADS_CONCURRENCY to zero, and uploads will be disabled. You can process
#   all the media faster when you skip the upload step.
#   Later, when all the media has been transformed, restart the app with YB_WORK_UPLOADS_CONCURRENCY
#   set to a positive number and all the pending uploads will be processed
#export YB_WORK_UPLOADS_CONCURRENCY=2

# This only controls Yuebing's server-side logging
